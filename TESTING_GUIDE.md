## Known Limitations

1. **QR Code Scanning**: Actual camera scanning requires HTTPS and proper camera permissions
2. **Real-time Updates**: Current implementation uses localStorage, not real-time database
3. **File Uploads**: Simulated in browser environment
4. **Push Notifications**: Not implemented in current version

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Backend Integration**: Replace localStorage with proper database
2. **HTTPS Setup**: Required for camera access
3. **Real-time Features**: Implement WebSocket connections
4. **Push Notifications**: Add for real-time updates
5. **Offline Support**: Implement service workers
6. **Security**: Add proper authentication and authorization
7. **Analytics**: Add user behavior tracking
8. **Error Monitoring**: Implement crash reporting
